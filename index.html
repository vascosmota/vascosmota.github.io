Hi. My name is Vasco, I am Data Scientist based off Lisboa, Portugal.

When I am not making sure data stays inside the pipelines in the cloud (cloud pipelines, who would have thought of that)), I will be reading, books, newspapers, magazines, to (try to) understand our world a little better.

As a worker in the "data industry", I feel a certain responsability to understand how these new techonlogical developments will impact our society. Digital law is on its infancy and we need to fight for our Digital Rights.
